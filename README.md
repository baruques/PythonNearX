Web3 Python Portfolio

This repository is a space dedicated to reviewing Python skills and applying them to various Web3 concepts. My goal is to solidify my understanding of the fundamental principles of Web3 development while building a portfolio of practical projects.

Project Goals:

  - Python Proficiency: Practice and enhance my Python programming skills through targeted exercises and project-based learning.
  - Web3 Fundamentals: Explore core Web3 topics, including blockchain interaction, smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and NFTs.
  - Portfolio Building: Create small, functional projects that showcase my abilities in the Web3 space. Examples may include scripts for interacting with blockchain APIs, simple smart contract deployments, or data analysis of on-chain information.

Content and Structure:

  - Code Review: The repository will contain code for various exercises and projects.
  - Documentation: Each project will have a clear README.md explaining its purpose, technologies used, and how to run it.

This is a journey of continuous learning and development. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!
